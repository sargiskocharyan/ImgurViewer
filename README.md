# ImgurViewer is technical task implementation written in swift 5.1 using Xcode 11.
As an architectural design pattern MVVM is used. The first screen shows most popolar images(with titles) of the day, the detail screen shows information about image and top comments with ratings of the comment.
The application doesn't use any 3rd party library: for networking and cachaing are used native iOS APIs.
